# G'day

I'm Matt Smith. I work as an advisor and consultant in the Learning & Development space. I do a bunch of stuff so it's probably best to take a look [here](https://thisismattsmith.com/work) if you're interested in what I do.

My repos are a mix of professional and personal projects.

For more info about me generally, check out my website: [thisismattsmith.com](https://thisismattsmith.com).
